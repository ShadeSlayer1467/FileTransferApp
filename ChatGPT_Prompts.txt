Write a C# "RecieveFile" class that has two "Computer" class type objects: 
1:(Name: RGBDesk, IP: 172.20.10.10, Port:69666) 
2:(Name: OmenLap, IP: 172.20.10.6, Port:69666)

This "RecieveFile" class will prompt the user in the command line to choose from the "Computer" objects to recieve files from. Then it will do the necassary things to recieve a file from that computer over an ipad WiFi hotspot




Now write me a C# "SendFile" class with the same "Computer" Objects as before that prompts the user for which computer to SEND files to and then performs the necessary procedures to send a file to that computer.




Now write a "Main" function to put these together as if they are in one solution and both computer have the program and one needs to choose to recieve, and the other needs to choose to send



Modify "Console.WriteLine("Enter the file path:"); string filePath = Console.ReadLine();" to open a file explorer window to select a file



how to fix "No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it" error




how would i modify "ReceiveFile" to make sure it has the same file name and file type as the incoming file?



modify the following C# code "class SendFile..." so that it sends the name of the file first then the rest of it



modify the following C# code so that it adds a new line character after the file name "...
byte[] fileNameBytes = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(fileName); 
stream.Write(fileNameBytes, 0, fileNameBytes.Length);
 ... "



modify the following C# code to wait for the "esc" keyboard press "while(true)
                    ReceiveFile.Receive(null);"




modify the following C# code to set the filename to the first line from the file "...
TcpClient client = listener.AcceptTcpClient();
            NetworkStream stream = client.GetStream();

            Console.WriteLine("Receiving file");

            using (FileStream fileStream = new FileStream("received_file.txt", FileMode.Create, FileAccess.Write))
            {
                int bytesRead;
                byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];

                while ((bytesRead = stream.Read(buffer, 0, buffer.Length)) > 0)
                {
                    fileStream.Write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);
                }
            }
..."


modify the above to trim all whitespace as well


Edit the following C# code so that it opens a file dialog to ask where you want to save the file "byte[] filenameBuffer = new byte[1024];
            int bytesRead = stream.Read(filenameBuffer, 0, filenameBuffer.Length);

            using (FileStream fileStream = new FileStream(fileName, FileMode.Create, FileAccess.Write))
            {
                bytesRead = 0;
                byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];

                while ((bytesRead = stream.Read(buffer, 0, buffer.Length)) > 0)
                {
                    fileStream.Write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);
                }
            }"
